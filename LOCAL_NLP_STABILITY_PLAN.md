# Local NLP Stability Investigation Plan

Repository:
`/Users/micaelsimoes/PycharmProjects/shared-resources-planning`

## Role and scope

Act as an implementation and diagnostic agent.

Read `REVISION_CONTEXT.md` first, then read this file. For the current P5.4 work, this file takes precedence regarding what may and may not be changed.

Work in small isolated experiments. After each stage report:

- files changed;
- exact diagnostic or code changes;
- commands executed;
- solver outcome;
- relevant numerical diagnostics;
- interpretation;
- whether the acceptance criterion was met.

Do not automatically proceed from a diagnostic result to a production formulation change.

# CURRENT AUTHORIZED STAGE - P5.4-D4 recourse branch recovery and oracle hardening

P5.4-A/B/C/D/D2/D2-P/D3/E/E2/H1/F are complete.

Accepted statuses:

- `P5.4-H1 PASS - complementarity is numerically resolved consistently across agents`
- `P5.4-F ADMM PASS - net-P/Q coordination converged with locally consistent charge/discharge`
- `P5.4-D2-P PASS - structurally complete S sensitivity productionized`
- `P5.4-D3 FAIL - current cuts are demonstrably unsafe under observed recourse branches`

The current authorized sequence is:

1. **P5.4-D4 - recover lower operational branches at the exact base candidate**;
2. **if recoverable, test a deterministic multi-start recourse oracle and hardened empirical cut**;
3. **planner review of planning architecture**;
4. **do not run P5.4-G** unless explicitly re-authorized after D4.

Current accepted production baseline:

`06e921e5`

Current accepted fixed-candidate ADMM behavior:

- converged in `9` cycles;
- zero local failures/recoveries;
- net-P/Q coordination only;
- H1 complementarity still enforced;
- converter capability clean.

Latest diagnostic evidence:

- `65b261ba` - D2 root-cause audit;
- `e1afa8e9` - D3 distributed cut-consistency audit.

# Locked production decisions during D4

Do not change:

- active-energy ESS formulation;
- D2-P sensitivity-clean shared-S formulation;
- H1 dimensionless complementarity;
- `ESS_COMPLEMENTARITY_TOLERANCE = 1e-4`;
- net-P/Q-only ADMM coordination;
- IPOPT tolerances/options;
- MA97/exact-Hessian policy;
- recovery policy;
- adaptive-rho logic;
- proximal regularization;
- objective scaling;
- objective coefficients;
- master/Benders equations;
- cut equations.

Do not add:

- `pch/pdch` consensus;
- binary charge/discharge variables;
- random multi-starts;
- new penalties;
- trust regions or planning regularization during D4 itself.

D4 is a diagnostic recourse-oracle stage.

---

# Accepted D2-P result

D2-P removed the four redundant positive-capacity numerical S-dependent bounds on:

- `shared_es_pch`;
- `shared_es_pdch`;
- `shared_es_pnet`;
- `shared_es_qnet`.

Retained symbolic rows imply the removed bounds exactly, so the mathematical feasible set is unchanged.

After D2-P:

- positive-capacity numerical bounds no longer depend on S;
- S-bound derivative contribution is exactly zero;
- the rated-S fixing-row dual is the structurally complete derivative of the **local branch returned by the solver**;
- E remains structurally sensitivity-clean;
- bootstrap initialization remains 36/36 DSO, 12/12 TSO, 3/3 ESSO, zero persistent failures;
- fixed-candidate ADMM still converges in 9 cycles.

Do not reopen D2-P unless D4 exposes a direct production regression attributable to it.

---

# Accepted D3 result - current planning cuts are unsafe

D3 evaluated the exact aggregated coefficient returned by production distributed operational planning and the exact affine cut form that `_add_benders_cut` would use, without adding the cut to a master.

Accepted D3 evidence:

- `Q0 = 848258809.814117` at the base positive-bootstrap candidate;
- all 18 aggregated S/E coefficients finite and negative;
- 8 nearby distributed candidate solves completed;
- 8/8 cut gaps negative;
- 6/8 cut gaps decisively below the derived tolerance;
- worst violation about `-1.1476e7`, roughly `-1.35%` of `Q0`;
- no tested candidate remained on the base branch;
- largest linear predicted capacity effect was smaller than the recourse-resolution scale.

The most important D3 observation is:

- at node 9, 2025, `S = 0.95*S0`, a converged distributed state achieved about `836789546.53`;
- reducing S tightens the feasible set;
- therefore the physical state found at `0.95*S0` is feasible at the larger base capacity;
- the base cold solve at `S0` missed a lower feasible branch by at least about `11.47e6`.

Do not call the lower value the global optimum. It is a best observed feasible branch and a falsification witness.

The current blocker is **recourse branch recovery**, not sensitivity bookkeeping.

# P5.4-D4 - recourse branch recovery and oracle hardening

## D4 objective

Determine whether lower recourse branches exposed by D3 can be recovered reproducibly at the **exact original base candidate**, and whether a small deterministic multi-start operational oracle can make branch selection sufficiently reliable for a later planning-architecture decision.

Do not run the outer planning loop.

## D4.1 - recover/persist D3 branch states

Recover or reproduce converged distributed states for at least:

- base positive-bootstrap candidate;
- `s|node9|2025 -5%` best observed state;
- `s|node9|2025 -10%` best observed state;
- `s|node5|2025 -5%` best observed state;
- `e|node9|2025 -1%` best observed state.

Persist/record enough state to reconstruct deterministic starts:

- candidate S/E capacities;
- ADMM consensus quantities;
- local primal variables;
- ESS SOC;
- H1 hat variables;
- relevant warm-start suffixes/multipliers;
- converged recourse and local objective decomposition.

If complete serialized states do not exist, rerun only what is necessary.

## D4.2 - lift the lower-S state to the exact base candidate

Start with `s|node9|2025 -5%`.

Restore the exact base capacities and transfer physical operational variables, including:

- `pch`;
- `pdch`;
- `pnet`;
- `qnet`;
- SOC;
- unrelated network variables;
- interface states/consensus initialization where compatible.

Recompute initialization-only normalized H1 values consistently with the restored base S:

`pch_hat = pch / S_base`

`pdch_hat = pdch / S_base`

Do **not** introduce division-by-S expressions into the optimization model.

Before solving, audit the transferred point against the base candidate and report maximum residuals for:

- active-sum;
- converter capability;
- complementarity;
- H1 links;
- SOC bounds/recursion where directly checkable;
- interface consistency quantities.

The smaller-S physical point should remain feasible when S is increased. Any violation must be explained before solving.

## D4.3 - multiplier-transfer policy

Separate primal branch transfer from multiplier transfer.

Required variants:

**A - primal-only branch recovery**

- transfer primal/consensus state;
- clear local IPOPT bound and constraint multipliers before the first local solve.

**B - compatible full warm start**

- transfer primal plus only multiplier information that remains semantically compatible with the restored-capacity NLP.

Do not silently reuse multipliers from the smaller-capacity NLP when row/bound meaning changed.

The primal-only result is the primary branch-recovery test.

## D4.4 - exact-base recovery population

Solve the **exact original positive-bootstrap candidate** using production distributed ADMM from at least:

1. production cold initialization;
2. lifted node9 `S -5%` state;
3. lifted node9 `S -10%` state;
4. lifted node5 `S -5%` state;
5. lifted node9 `E -1%` state where semantically meaningful.

For every start record:

- converged yes/no;
- ADMM cycles;
- local primary/recovery outcomes;
- final recourse;
- gross operational cost;
- terminal salvage;
- final residuals;
- complementarity and converter-capability residuals;
- final S/E sensitivity vector;
- branch fingerprint.

Repeat each materially distinct low base branch at least twice from the same deterministic initialization to establish reproducibility.

## D4.5 - decisive base-branch answer

Answer explicitly:

**Can the exact original base candidate attain a recourse materially below `848258809.814117`?**

If yes, report:

`Q_base_best_observed`

and:

`Delta_Q_base = Q_base_cold - Q_base_best_observed`.

Never call `Q_base_best_observed` the global optimum.

## D4.6 - branch fingerprint / objective-gap localization

Compare the cold base branch and each lower recovered base branch using at least:

- TSO objective;
- each DSO objective;
- ESSO objective;
- generation cost;
- flexibility cost;
- voltage-slack cost;
- network/operational slack penalties;
- ESS usage/complementarity penalties;
- terminal salvage;
- shared-ESS P/Q schedules;
- SOC trajectories;
- interface P/Q;
- voltage profiles.

Identify the agent/year/day/model responsible for most of the objective gap and then identify the physical/optimization variables that differ there.

Do not use total recourse alone as a branch label.

## D4.7 - deterministic diagnostic multi-start oracle

If multiple base branches are reproducibly recoverable, define a **diagnostic** deterministic oracle:

`Q_best_observed(x) = min(Q_start1, Q_start2, ..., Q_startK)`

over converged feasible deterministic starts.

Initial start families should include:

- production cold initialization;
- previous/incumbent converged candidate where available;
- one or more archived branch templates lifted/mapped to the candidate.

No random starts.

Do not productionize the oracle during D4.

## D4.8 - multi-start cost/benefit

On the base candidate and existing D3 candidate set, measure:

- number of starts;
- total ADMM solves;
- runtime;
- best recourse recovered;
- branch frequency;
- marginal improvement from the second, third, fourth start.

Identify the smallest deterministic start set that consistently recovers the best known branch.

The goal is to avoid a large multiplicative runtime increase if two starts recover nearly all of the benefit.

## D4.9 - hardened empirical cut test

Run this only if D4.7 yields a reproducible best-observed base branch.

At the exact base candidate:

1. take `Q_base_best_observed`;
2. extract the fully aggregated S/E sensitivity from that **same converged branch**;
3. construct, but do not add to a master:

`L_best(x) = Q_base_best_observed + g_best^T (x - x0)`.

Re-evaluate against the already completed D3 candidates using each candidate's own deterministic best-observed recourse.

Report:

`cut_gap_best = Q_best_observed(x) - L_best(x)`.

Negative gap beyond the derived tolerance remains a decisive unsafe-cut witness.

No observed violation does **not** establish global Benders validity.

## D4.10 - minimal expansion only if needed

If the hardened base cut survives all existing D3 falsification points, add only a small targeted set:

- node9 S `+5%`;
- node9 S `+10%`;
- node5 S `+5%`;
- node9 E `+5%`;
- one node7 perturbation.

Stop immediately if another decisive cut violation appears.

Do not launch a full matrix unless planner review later requests it.

## D4.11 - required classification

End D4 with exactly one:

`P5.4-D4 A - lower recourse branch is reproducibly recoverable with a practical deterministic oracle`

`P5.4-D4 B - lower branch exists but recourse recovery is not practically reliable`

`P5.4-D4 C - hardened recourse still produces demonstrably unsafe cuts`

Interpretation:

- **D4-A:** discuss a deterministic multi-start recourse oracle plus local/trust-region planning heuristic; do not call it globally valid classical Benders.
- **D4-B:** branch recovery is too expensive/unstable; prepare alternatives to derivative-cut planning.
- **D4-C:** even a hardened anchor produces unsafe cuts; current classical/local cut machinery must not be used as-is.

Do not implement a new planning architecture without planner approval.

---

# P5.4-G - blocked pending D4 planner review

Do not invoke `run_planning_problem()` during D4.

G may be reconsidered only after explicit planner review of D4 and a planning-architecture decision.

A structurally complete local derivative is not enough. The recourse oracle must first be made reliable enough for the intended planning method, or the planning method must change.

---

# Deferred items

Keep deferred during D4:

- physical complementarity tolerance `1e-5` / `1e-6` A/B;
- B1 exact `f_ref=0`;
- RES B2-R until defensible converter `Smax` data exists;
- calendar degradation;
- solver/ADMM retuning;
- Benders/master modification;
- trust-region/planning-regularization implementation.

---

# Current required report

Continue:

`P5_4_ACTIVE_ENERGY_ESS_PRODUCTIONIZATION_REPORT.md`.

Add:

`D4 - recourse branch recovery and oracle hardening`.

Do not issue the final P5.4 verdict and do not run G.

Finish with the exact D4 A/B/C classification and then:

`P5.4-D4 COMPLETE - ready for planner decision on planning architecture`

and stop.

---

# COMPLETED STAGE — P5.3 (historical execution record)

This historical section superseded the older frozen-cycle-only instructions during P5.3. It no longer defines the active scope; P5.4 above is authoritative.

The historical frozen-model work remains valid evidence and is summarized later in this file, but the primary P5.3 population is now the real current SRP1 positive-bootstrap cold initialization produced through the production candidate/model-construction path.

Current accepted production checkpoint:

`f77d829359ffd873367f556882546bc2dcc8ec99`

Current reduced-scenario identity:

- seed `2026`;
- combined scenario checksum:
  `5a02b77ccbbbbbb869de92958a3851d095624711abc2dbfc0157466064410358`.

P5.3 was a diagnostic/reformulation review. Its B3 direction has now received planner approval for controlled P5.4 productionization, not direct acceptance of the diagnostic wrapper.

## Current P5.3 invariants

Do not:

- tune IPOPT `tol`, `acceptable_tol`, `acceptable_iter`, `max_iter`, or pushes;
- switch production MA97/MA57 policy;
- change recovery classification;
- change ADMM rho rules or tolerances;
- change recourse-stationarity criteria;
- change ADMM objective scaling;
- change TSO proximal regularization;
- change Benders/local-cut logic;
- add generic feasibility slacks;
- productionize the P5.2 shared-ESS narrow band;
- cap shared-ESS `kappa`;
- change the stochastic scenario values during exact RES algebra A/B tests;
- add calendar degradation;
- modify terminal salvage;
- silently change ESS complementarity tolerance.

The active-power ESS network prototype described below is explicitly authorized as a diagnostic physical reformulation. Full ESSO cycling-degradation conversion is not part of P5.3-B3.

---

# P5.3 checkpoint after A/A2 — AUTHORITATIVE

P5.3-A and P5.3-A2 are complete. The detailed A/A-RES instructions retained below are historical execution records and **must not be rerun wholesale** unless a later B experiment explicitly requests a targeted derivative control.

Authoritative findings:

- full equality Jacobians are exactly row-rank deficient at the positive-bootstrap cold start because of `sess_snet_def` only;
- zero equality rows: 24 per DSO model, 72 per TSO model;
- full `sigma_min = 0` and full condition number is formally infinite;
- after removing only the exactly-zero rows, the tested reduced equality Jacobians have full row rank and no additional nullity;
- corrected reduced condition numbers are approximately `8.98e4` for DSOs and `1.42e3` for the TSO;
- the previous claim that TSO equality conditioning is worse is withdrawn;
- the previous near-zero `pij/qij` DSO column result is withdrawn as a derivative-audit artifact caused by uninitialized `r_sqr` rows being skipped;
- `sess_snet_def` remains HIGH risk: exact zero gradient, always-active equality, sole source of exact equality-rank deficiency, curvature up to about `18806`;
- `sess_comp` remains HIGH risk: tiny Jacobian and tiny `S_rated^2`-scaled margin;
- `sg_capability` remains HIGH risk: 3732 active rows, zero cold-start margin, gradients down to about `5.44e-5`;
- all 144 current SRP1 curtailable RES instances have `power_factor_control=True`; therefore `gen_pf_profile` is never instantiated and the old exact RES B2 cleanup is cancelled for SRP1;
- current RES synthetic `q_available` is zero, so `sg_available = P_available` and the capability circle collapses with stochastic active availability;
- RES `abs()` reflection is negligible; upper-support overshoot is material, reaching about `33.5%` above historical maxima in some season/type calls;
- the realized reduced SRP1 population has no values in `(0,1e-5]`, but 17 live values in `(1e-5,1e-4]`;
- cross-generator spatial correlation is not preserved by the current same-type pooled sampling assignment;
- DSO interface magnitude is intentionally freed in ADMM; the earlier claim of persistent DSO magnitude pinning is withdrawn;
- IPOPT internally scales the objective gradient but does not supply comparable constraint-row scaling.

## Historical B-series execution order (completed)

The user deliberately selected the following order because the RES capability experiment is easier and quicker to debug and validate than the active-power ESS refactor:

1. **P5.3-B1 — exact reference-angle gauge**;
2. **P5.3-B2-R — RES capability semantics and conditioning**;
3. **P5.3-B3 — active-power ESS structural prototype**.

B3 remains the highest expected structural-payoff experiment, but it is executed third for practical validation reasons.

Do not test more shared-ESS epsilon values or scalar `kappa` caps. Do not retune solver options.

---

# P5.3-A — Quantitative structural conditioning audit (COMPLETE — historical execution instructions)

## A1. Reproduce the real positive-bootstrap population

Generate the exact P5 iteration-2 positive-bootstrap candidate using production:

`_build_positive_bootstrap_candidate(...)`

and replay the real pre-solve initialization path.

Audit every network SMOPF immediately before IPOPT:

- 36 DSO models;
- 12 TSO models.

Retain ESSO models for structural context, but the primary derivative audit is the 48 network SMOPFs.

Do not reconstruct the bootstrap candidate manually.

The old frozen cycle-10 pickle may be used only as historical/control evidence.

## A2. Inspect the installed derivative environment first

Determine the safest available mechanism for evaluating the NLP Jacobian and related derivatives.

Prefer analytic Pyomo/PyNumero/NLP interfaces already available in the environment.

Do not introduce a large external dependency merely for this audit.

If an exact sparse Jacobian interface is unavailable, report that limitation before implementing a materially different numerical approach.

## A3. Constraint-family inventory

Enumerate every active network constraint component and classify it as:

- linear equality;
- linear inequality;
- nonlinear equality;
- nonlinear inequality;
- ranged nonlinear inequality.

For every family report:

- row count;
- polynomial degree where available;
- variables participating;
- typical variable magnitude;
- whether variables/row residuals can naturally be near zero;
- whether a row can be active at a zero-gradient point;
- whether stochastic data can switch the row on/off structurally.

Explicitly include at least:

- `voltage_mag_def`;
- `voltage_mag_sqr_def`;
- `voltage_setpoint_cons`;
- `voltage_product_real_def`;
- `voltage_product_imag_def`;
- `r_sqr_def`;
- `sg_capability`;
- `gen_pf_upper`;
- `gen_pf_lower`;
- `gen_pf_profile`;
- `flex_energy_balance_p`;
- `ess_pnet_def`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `ess_comp`;
- `ess_soc_def`;
- `sess_pnet_def`;
- `sess_snet_def`;
- `sess_comp`;
- `sess_soc_def`;
- `node_balance_p`;
- `node_balance_q`;
- `branch_flow_limit`;
- `branch_flow_limit_ji`;
- all distributed coordination/interface constraints added after base model construction.

## A4. Jacobian diagnostics at the cold start

For every active row, where technically available, compute:

- absolute constraint residual / violation;
- `||grad g||_2`;
- `||grad g||_inf`;
- smallest nonzero absolute Jacobian coefficient;
- largest absolute Jacobian coefficient;
- intra-row coefficient ratio;
- distance to the nearest inequality bound;
- `distance_to_bound / IPOPT_tol` using that model's actual configured `tol`.

Do not hide zero-gradient rows.

Report counts of rows with gradient norm below:

- `1e-12`;
- `1e-10`;
- `1e-8`;
- `1e-6`;
- `1e-4`.

These are diagnostic bins only.

Group by component, agent/network, year, and representative day.

Produce ranked top-N summaries for:

- smallest row norms;
- largest row norms;
- smallest inequality margins relative to IPOPT tolerance;
- largest intra-row derivative-scale ratios.

## A5. Jacobian column and near-dependence diagnostics

Report:

- zero/near-zero derivative columns;
- smallest/largest column norms;
- suspicious variable families.

Where practical, estimate:

- equality-Jacobian numerical rank;
- smallest singular values;
- largest singular value;
- a condition estimate.

At minimum do this for:

- one representative TSO model;
- one representative model from each DSO;
- every previously sensitive/failing positive-bootstrap state.

If full SVD is impractical, use a sparse extremal-singular-value or rank-revealing alternative and state the limitation.

Also identify pairs/groups of equality rows with nearly collinear normalized gradients.

## A6. Constraint-curvature audit

For nonlinear quadratic/bilinear rows report raw second-derivative/Hessian coefficient scales where practical.

Pay particular attention to:

- `sess_snet_def`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `sess_comp`;
- `ess_comp`;
- `sg_capability`;
- branch-current/apparent-power limits;
- squared-voltage/product definitions.

For shared ESS explicitly evaluate the bootstrap power ratings:

- `1.0635e-4 p.u.`;
- `2.1270e-4 p.u.`;
- `3.1905e-4 p.u.`;

with current:

`kappa = 1/S_rated`.

Distinguish clearly among:

- small Jacobian;
- large curvature;
- tiny inequality margin;
- exact rank degeneracy;
- near-linear dependence.

Do not collapse them into one generic "bad conditioning" label.

## A7. Objective-gradient scale

At the cold start report objective-gradient norms/coefficient ranges for major components that are present:

- physical/economic SMOPF objective;
- scenario-deviation regularization;
- proximal terms;
- ADMM augmentation.

Compare objective-gradient scale with suspicious constraint-Jacobian scales.

Do not change objective scaling.

---

# P5.3-A-RES — Stochastic RES and low-output audit (COMPLETE — historical execution instructions)

The current load and RES realizations come from historical-data-based copula/KDE models. Do not replace the copula model in this stage.

## RES1. Raw support and `abs()` post-processing

Instrument RES generation so the inverse-transformed samples are inspected **before**:

`np.abs(...)`.

For each network / season / RES type (PV, Wind) report:

- number of sampled hourly values;
- number/percentage negative before `abs`;
- minimum negative value;
- total/magnitude of positive generation created solely by reflection of negative samples;
- values above historical maximum;
- values below historical minimum;
- relevant quantiles before and after post-processing.

Do not alter `np.abs` during this audit.

## RES2. Tiny-generation population in the realized SMOPFs

After conversion to p.u. and after the actual one-scenario realization is selected, count available RES values in:

- exactly zero;
- `(0, 1e-6]`;
- `(1e-6, 1e-5]`;
- `(1e-5, 1e-4]`;
- `(1e-4, 1e-3]`;
- `>1e-3`.

For tiny values report exact:

- network;
- generator id/type;
- year;
- day;
- hour.

Cross-reference them with:

- `renewable_generation_is_unavailable`;
- `sg_capability`;
- `gen_pf_profile`;
- PF-control rows;
- local solve failures;
- unusually high IPOPT iteration counts where available.

Quantify how often the current structural switch at `EQUALITY_TOLERANCE` is exercised or nearly exercised.

Do not select a replacement threshold yet.

## RES3. Reactive-power/profile assumptions

For every curtailable RES generator report:

- `power_factor_control`;
- `min_pf`, `max_pf`;
- physical `pmax`, `qmin`, `qmax`;
- stochastic `pg_available`;
- stochastic `qg_available`;
- whether `qg_available` is identically zero;
- whether `gen_pf_profile` is instantiated;
- whether `sg_capability` is instantiated.

Explicitly identify rows where:

`q_available * pg == p_available * qg`

reduces to:

`p_available * qg == 0`

with very small positive `p_available`.

## RES4. Apparent-power capability interpretation

Determine whether current stochastic `sg_available = sqrt(pg_available^2 + qg_available^2)` is intentionally representing converter MVA rating or only stochastic renewable availability.

If `qg_available = 0`, the current capability radius collapses to `pg_available`.

Report whether the data/model contains a separate physical inverter MVA rating that could support a cleaner separation:

- stochastic active availability: `0 <= pg <= P_available`;
- converter capability: `pg^2 + qg^2 <= S_converter^2`.

Do not implement this physical change in the exact RES B2 experiment unless separately approved; it may change the feasible set.

## RES5. Spatial/scenario correlation observation

Audit how generated PV/wind profiles are assigned to individual generators.

Determine whether generator-to-generator spatial correlation is preserved or whether same-type generators effectively draw independently from a common synthetic pool.

Report this as a scenario-realism finding, separate from local NLP conditioning.

Do not change the sampling architecture in P5.3.

---

# P5.3-A-extra — Other structural checks

## Reference-angle/gauge audit

Confirm current reference-bus treatment of `f` and quantify any residual rotational/gauge degree of freedom.

Also audit DSO reference-bus `e` bounds and determine whether they effectively pin the coordinated interface voltage despite `enforce_vg = false`.

Do not change them in Phase A.

## Transformer auxiliary audit

Determine whether `r` and `r_sqr` variables constructed for non-transformer branches enter the generated NL problem.

If the writer eliminates them, classify as code cleanliness only.

If they reach IPOPT as unused/weakly-connected variables, classify as a conditioning issue.

## Branch-current audit

Quantify cancellation and derivative scales in current-limited branch rows based on:

`V_i^2 + V_j^2 - 2*W_ij_real`

multiplied by branch series-admittance magnitude squared.

Report whether low-impedance DSO branches create extreme coefficients or cancellation-sensitive constraints.

Do not reformulate branch currents unless this family ranks materially high.

---

# P5.3-A required output

Produce:

`P5_3_A_SMOPF_CONDITIONING_AUDIT.md`

Include a ranked `HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` table for suspicious formulation families.

For every HIGH-risk item state:

- mathematical form;
- observed numerical evidence;
- physical role;
- exact failure mode: zero gradient, poor scale, near dependence, tiny margin, large curvature, etc.;
- possible exact reformulation;
- possible deliberate physical reformulation;
- expected numerical benefit;
- risk of changing the feasible set.

P5.3-A/A2 are complete. Do not rerun the full audit before B1/B2-R/B3; use only targeted derivative controls required by the specific experiment.

---

# P5.3-B1 — Exact reference-angle A/B

Proceed only if Phase A confirms that fixing the reference imaginary voltage does not violate an intentional interface convention.

Start from fresh accepted production models.

Do not carry any P5.2 narrow-band ESS change into this branch.

A — current production reference treatment.

B — exact gauge:

`f_ref = 0`.

Change only this fixing/bound condition.

Keep every other production equation and solver option unchanged.

Run the complete positive-bootstrap initialization.

Report:

- 51 final local outcomes;
- 48 network primary/recovery outcomes;
- IPOPT iterations;
- KKT metrics;
- objective values;
- failures by identity;
- equality-Jacobian rank/smallest-singular-value change on representative models;
- interface V/P/Q differences.

Acceptance:

- no material physical/economic change;
- no new failure family;
- gauge ambiguity removed;
- conditioning not worse.

Diagnostic only. Do not productionize automatically.

---

# P5.3-B2-R — RES capability semantics and conditioning

Run this **second**, after B1 and before B3.

Use a fresh accepted production baseline. Do not stack B1.

The old B2 exact fixed-PF/profile cleanup is cancelled for SRP1 because all 144 curtailable SRP1 RES instances have `power_factor_control=True`, so `gen_pf_profile` is never instantiated.

B2-R is a semantics-first diagnostic. It must not invent a converter rating.

## B2-R.1 Rating semantics first

For every curtailable SRP1 RES generator inspect:

- `pmax`;
- `pmin`;
- `qmax`;
- `qmin`;
- `min_pf`, `max_pf`;
- generator type;
- any explicit `S_rated`, inverter rating, converter rating, nameplate MVA field, or equivalent metadata;
- network JSON comments/metadata;
- historical operational-data units/meaning.

Determine whether the repository contains an **explicit defensible converter apparent-power rating**.

Do not infer `S_converter` merely because `pmax` and `qmax/qmin` exist unless their documented semantics make that inference unambiguous.

If no defensible converter MVA rating exists, STOP B2-R before formulation implementation and recommend the minimum data-model extension required.

Do not synthesize a rating from an arbitrary heuristic.

## B2-R.2 Explain the current RES feasible set

Current production effectively has:

`0 <= pg <= P_available`

plus:

`pg^2 + qg^2 <= S_available^2`

where:

`S_available = sqrt(P_available^2 + Q_available^2)`.

For the current synthetic SRP1 RES data:

`Q_available = 0`,

so:

`S_available = P_available`.

Explain mathematically, together with the active PF cone, what reactive-power capability remains at:

- `pg = P_available`;
- partial active dispatch;
- very low `P_available`;
- `P_available = 0`.

State whether the current behavior appears physically intentional or is likely a conflation of stochastic resource availability with converter/inverter MVA capability.

## B2-R.3 Conditional physical prototype

Proceed only if B2-R.1 finds an explicit defensible `S_converter`.

Create an isolated diagnostic formulation:

stochastic resource availability:

`0 <= pg <= P_available`

converter capability:

`pg^2 + qg^2 <= S_converter^2`

while retaining the existing PF-control inequalities and all stochastic scenario values unchanged.

This is a deliberate feasible-set change, not an exact algebraic rewrite.

Do not change:

- PF limits;
- RES-off threshold;
- stochastic samples;
- objective penalties;
- IPOPT settings;
- ADMM/planning settings.

## B2-R.4 Numerical and physical comparison

If the conditional prototype is implemented, compare production vs B2-R for:

- all 17 realized low-output rows in `(1e-5,1e-4] p.u.`;
- representative normal-output rows;
- all 48 network positive-bootstrap initialization solves;
- final 51 local outcomes where the unchanged ESSO initialization is relevant.

Report:

- `sg_capability` cold-start margin;
- row-gradient norm;
- whether the capability row is active at the cold start;
- primary/recovery/persistent failure counts;
- IPOPT iteration distribution and runtime;
- P/Q capability and dispatch;
- RES curtailment;
- local objective;
- interface V/P/Q;
- any new physical degrees of freedom introduced by separating availability from converter rating.

Determine whether the tiny active capability circle at low stochastic generation disappears when the converter radius is based on a fixed physical rating.

## B2-R.5 Stochastic-support recommendation — diagnostic only

Do not change the copula/KDE generator in B2-R.

Based on P5.3-A2, provide a separate recommendation on:

- handling of synthetic samples above physical/historical support;
- whether post-generation clipping to an explicit physical/nameplate maximum is justified;
- whether the marginal model itself should be bounded;
- how generator-site/spatial dependence should be represented in a later scenario-model revision;
- whether the current negligible `abs()` reflection still merits cleanup for physical clarity even though it is not a material numerical driver.

Keep stochastic-model recommendations separate from the NLP capability result.

## B2-R acceptance

Classify B2-R as one of:

- `PRODUCTIONIZE CANDIDATE` — explicit converter rating exists and the separated formulation improves physical semantics/conditioning without unacceptable regressions;
- `CONTINUE TESTING` — data/formulation is promising but evidence is incomplete;
- `DEFER — DATA MODEL REQUIRED` — no defensible converter rating exists;
- `REJECT` — reformulation is unsupported or creates unacceptable behavior.

Do not productionize automatically.

# P5.3-B3 — Active-power ESS structural prototype

Run this **third**, after B1 and B2-R. It remains the highest expected structural-payoff experiment, but is intentionally sequenced last because it is the largest refactor to debug and validate.

Use another **fresh accepted production baseline**.

Do not stack B1 or B2-R.

This is an authorized diagnostic physical reformulation, not an exact algebraic rewrite.

## B3.1 Trace all affected consumers first

Before changing a diagnostic branch, trace every network/coordination/ESSO consumer of:

- `sch`;
- `sdch`;
- `pch`;
- `pdch`;
- `pnet`;
- `qnet`;
- SOC;
- complementarity;
- converter limits;
- result processing;
- ADMM shared-ESS P/Q coupling;
- degradation/throughput.

Confirm that network-agent coordination is based on aggregate P/Q schedules and identify every place that would break if `sch/sdch` were removed.

## B3.2 Network SMOPF prototype

For ordinary and shared network ESS prototype:

`pnet = pch - pdch`

SOC from active power:

`SOC_t = SOC_{t-1} + eta_ch*pch*Delta_t - pdch*Delta_t/eta_dch`

Use the actual model time basis for `Delta_t`; do not assume it silently.

Converter capability:

`pnet^2 + qnet^2 <= S_rated^2`.

Reactive power remains converter loading but does not directly change stored battery energy.

Remove from the network diagnostic prototype:

- `sch`;
- `sdch`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `sess_snet_def`;
- `ess_pch_link`;
- `ess_pdch_link`;
- `sess_pch_link`;
- `sess_pdch_link`.

Replace the old apparent-power sum limit with explicit active-power bounds/sum constraints justified from the original device rating and intended physical behavior.

Complementarity acts on:

`pch * pdch`.

Do not silently change the configured complementarity tolerance.

Audit the new complementarity row's scale explicitly. If it remains a high-risk tiny bilinear inequality, report that rather than hiding it with arbitrary scaling.

Shared-ESS zero-capacity gating must remain safe.

## B3.3 Required physics tests

Demonstrate:

- pure Q: `pch = pdch = pnet = 0`, `qnet != 0` leaves SOC unchanged;
- pure charging changes SOC according to efficiency and time step;
- pure discharging changes SOC according to efficiency and time step;
- reactive power remains feasible up to converter capability;
- simultaneous active charging/discharging respects the intended complementarity semantics;
- zero-capacity shared ESS remains completely inactive;
- ordinary/shared P/Q sign conventions remain consistent with nodal balance and exported results.

## B3.4 Numerical tests

Run the complete positive-bootstrap **network initialization** and compare against current production:

- primary failures;
- recovery attempts;
- persistent failures;
- iterations;
- zero/near-zero Jacobian-row counts;
- smallest singular values / rank estimates where available;
- suspicious curvature coefficients;
- objective;
- P/Q schedules;
- SOC trajectories.

Do not enter ADMM with a partially converted ESS formulation unless all required ESSO/state-mapping dependencies are implemented consistently.

Do not rewrite ESSO cycling degradation in B3.

If the network prototype is favorable, produce a precise follow-on end-to-end plan covering:

- ESSO per-cohort `pch/pdch`;
- aggregate P/Q coordination;
- active/cell-side throughput;
- cycling degradation;
- SoH;
- sensitivities;
- state mapping;
- result exports.

Calendar degradation remains out of scope.

# Isolation and commit discipline

B1, B2-R, and B3 are independent A/B experiments.

Each begins from the same accepted current production baseline.

Do not accumulate B1 into B2-R, B2-R into B3, or otherwise stack favorable diagnostic changes during P5.3-B.

Diagnostic scripts/tests may be added, but production source files must be restored to the accepted baseline at the end of each diagnostic branch unless a later planner instruction explicitly authorizes a production commit.

Do not combine production edits from this stage into existing accepted commits.

# P5.3-B required report

Produce:

`P5_3_B_REFORMULATION_REPORT.md`

with separate sections for:

1. B1 — exact reference-angle gauge;
2. B2-R — RES capability semantics/conditioning, or the documented data-model stop if no defensible converter rating exists;
3. B3 — active-power ESS structural prototype.

For each candidate give one of:

`PRODUCTIONIZE / CONTINUE TESTING / REJECT / DEFER`.

The report must include, where applicable:

- before/after NLP dimensions;
- primary/recovery/persistent failure counts;
- IPOPT iteration/runtime comparisons;
- Jacobian rank/singular-value/curvature evidence;
- physical-equivalence statement for exact changes;
- deliberate-feasible-set-change statement for physical reformulations;
- interface V/P/Q effects;
- objective/dispatch effects;
- stochastic-data implications kept separate from NLP formulation implications.

Answer explicitly:

- Should `f_ref = 0` be adopted?
- Does B2-R confirm that current RES capability conflates stochastic availability with converter MVA rating?
- Is there sufficient data to reformulate RES converter capability safely?
- If B2-R is blocked by missing rating data, what exact data-model extension is required?
- What should be done about copula upper-support overshoot and missing spatial correlation?
- Does the active-power ESS formulation remove the exact equality-rank deficiency?
- Does it materially improve bootstrap NLP robustness?
- Does `pch * pdch` complementarity remain numerically problematic?
- Can `sch/sdch` be removed safely from the network SMOPF?
- Is the P5.2 narrow-band workaround still necessary after B3?
- Which nonlinear family is the highest remaining numerical risk after the successful reformulations?

Finish exactly:

`P5.3-B COMPLETE — reformulation experiments ready for planner decision`

Then stop.

# Historical evidence retained for reference

The following summarizes earlier local-NLP work. It remains valid evidence but does not constrain P5.3 where the current-stage instructions above explicitly supersede it.

## Original frozen reference failure

Historical frozen model:

`data/SRP1/Results/FrozenSMOPF/frozen_DSO_node7_case33_2_2025_Winter_cycle10.pkl`

Metadata:

- DSO node 7;
- `case33_2`;
- 2025 Winter;
- ADMM cycle 10;
- warm start;
- `rho_v = 1.5`;
- `rho_pf = 2.25`;
- `rho_ess = 3.375`.

Repeated baseline:

- primary exact-Hessian MA97: `internalSolverError / Error in step computation`;
- limited-memory recovery: `maxIterations`.

Tightening only explicit `vmag` or `vmag_sqr` bounds did not help.

Removing non-reference explicit `vmag` variables/equalities from the active DSO NLP converted the decisive frozen failure into a clean primary exact-Hessian success. This led to the accepted production `vmag_nodes` refactor.

## P2/P3 progression

The production `vmag_nodes` refactor passed multiple preserved local failures and live seed-2026 operational smoke tests.

Residual failures then localized around network-side shared-ESS operation. Audits identified the shared-ESS squared-magnitude equality as a major candidate because all derivatives vanish near zero dispatch.

Removing the row entirely fixed failures but materially violated the relation and was rejected.

Equivalent in-place scaling experiments proved that row normalization itself could clear decisive DSO and TSO exact-Hessian failures while preserving the physical equality.

## P4 accepted scaling

Shared ESS:

`kappa * ((sch-sdch)^2 - pnet^2 - qnet^2) = 0`, `kappa = 1/S_rated`.

Ordinary ESS uses the analogous immutable build-time scale.

The shared scale is mutable on reused models and preserves KKT multiplier consistency when capacity changes.

## P5 planning integration

Zero-investment operational evaluation converged cleanly, but the tiny positive-bootstrap candidate exposed new cold-start failures before ADMM.

Scalar caps on shared-ESS `kappa` produced strongly non-monotone convergence and relocated failures.

## P5.2 narrow-band evidence

Replacing the hard shared-ESS zero-gradient equality by a tiny two-sided ranged row gave the first full positive-bootstrap initialization with zero persistent failures. At `epsilon_rel = 1e-4`, all 48 network solves succeeded on the primary exact-Hessian path with zero recovery.

However, the nominal physical band was below the solver's effective feasibility resolution at tiny capacity, especially in TSO models. This is why P5.3 now prioritizes a broader structural formulation audit rather than productionizing the narrow-band workaround.

## Role and scope

Act as an implementation and diagnostic agent.

Read `REVISION_CONTEXT.md` first, then read this file. For the current P5.3 work, this file takes precedence regarding what may and may not be changed.

Work in small isolated experiments. After each stage report:

- files changed;
- exact diagnostic or code changes;
- commands executed;
- solver outcome;
- relevant numerical diagnostics;
- interpretation;
- whether the acceptance criterion was met.

Do not automatically proceed from a diagnostic result to a production formulation change.

# CURRENT AUTHORIZED STAGE — P5.3

This section supersedes the older frozen-cycle-only instructions and older prohibition on active-energy SOC work **for P5.3 only**.

The historical frozen-model work remains valid evidence and is summarized later in this file, but the primary P5.3 population is now the real current SRP1 positive-bootstrap cold initialization produced through the production candidate/model-construction path.

Current accepted production checkpoint:

`f77d829359ffd873367f556882546bc2dcc8ec99`

Current reduced-scenario identity:

- seed `2026`;
- combined scenario checksum:
  `5a02b77ccbbbbbb869de92958a3851d095624711abc2dbfc0157466064410358`.

P5.3 is a diagnostic/reformulation review. No P5.3 mathematical change becomes production code without planner approval.

## Current P5.3 invariants

Do not:

- tune IPOPT `tol`, `acceptable_tol`, `acceptable_iter`, `max_iter`, or pushes;
- switch production MA97/MA57 policy;
- change recovery classification;
- change ADMM rho rules or tolerances;
- change recourse-stationarity criteria;
- change ADMM objective scaling;
- change TSO proximal regularization;
- change Benders/local-cut logic;
- add generic feasibility slacks;
- productionize the P5.2 shared-ESS narrow band;
- cap shared-ESS `kappa`;
- change the stochastic scenario values during exact RES algebra A/B tests;
- add calendar degradation;
- modify terminal salvage;
- silently change ESS complementarity tolerance.

The active-power ESS network prototype described below is explicitly authorized as a diagnostic physical reformulation. Full ESSO cycling-degradation conversion is not part of P5.3-B3.

# P5.3-A — Quantitative structural conditioning audit

## A1. Reproduce the real positive-bootstrap population

Generate the exact P5 iteration-2 positive-bootstrap candidate using production:

`_build_positive_bootstrap_candidate(...)`

and replay the real pre-solve initialization path.

Audit every network SMOPF immediately before IPOPT:

- 36 DSO models;
- 12 TSO models.

Retain ESSO models for structural context, but the primary derivative audit is the 48 network SMOPFs.

Do not reconstruct the bootstrap candidate manually.

The old frozen cycle-10 pickle may be used only as historical/control evidence.

## A2. Inspect the installed derivative environment first

Determine the safest available mechanism for evaluating the NLP Jacobian and related derivatives.

Prefer analytic Pyomo/PyNumero/NLP interfaces already available in the environment.

Do not introduce a large external dependency merely for this audit.

If an exact sparse Jacobian interface is unavailable, report that limitation before implementing a materially different numerical approach.

## A3. Constraint-family inventory

Enumerate every active network constraint component and classify it as:

- linear equality;
- linear inequality;
- nonlinear equality;
- nonlinear inequality;
- ranged nonlinear inequality.

For every family report:

- row count;
- polynomial degree where available;
- variables participating;
- typical variable magnitude;
- whether variables/row residuals can naturally be near zero;
- whether a row can be active at a zero-gradient point;
- whether stochastic data can switch the row on/off structurally.

Explicitly include at least:

- `voltage_mag_def`;
- `voltage_mag_sqr_def`;
- `voltage_setpoint_cons`;
- `voltage_product_real_def`;
- `voltage_product_imag_def`;
- `r_sqr_def`;
- `sg_capability`;
- `gen_pf_upper`;
- `gen_pf_lower`;
- `gen_pf_profile`;
- `flex_energy_balance_p`;
- `ess_pnet_def`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `ess_comp`;
- `ess_soc_def`;
- `sess_pnet_def`;
- `sess_snet_def`;
- `sess_comp`;
- `sess_soc_def`;
- `node_balance_p`;
- `node_balance_q`;
- `branch_flow_limit`;
- `branch_flow_limit_ji`;
- all distributed coordination/interface constraints added after base model construction.

## A4. Jacobian diagnostics at the cold start

For every active row, where technically available, compute:

- absolute constraint residual / violation;
- `||grad g||_2`;
- `||grad g||_inf`;
- smallest nonzero absolute Jacobian coefficient;
- largest absolute Jacobian coefficient;
- intra-row coefficient ratio;
- distance to the nearest inequality bound;
- `distance_to_bound / IPOPT_tol` using that model's actual configured `tol`.

Do not hide zero-gradient rows.

Report counts of rows with gradient norm below:

- `1e-12`;
- `1e-10`;
- `1e-8`;
- `1e-6`;
- `1e-4`.

These are diagnostic bins only.

Group by component, agent/network, year, and representative day.

Produce ranked top-N summaries for:

- smallest row norms;
- largest row norms;
- smallest inequality margins relative to IPOPT tolerance;
- largest intra-row derivative-scale ratios.

## A5. Jacobian column and near-dependence diagnostics

Report:

- zero/near-zero derivative columns;
- smallest/largest column norms;
- suspicious variable families.

Where practical, estimate:

- equality-Jacobian numerical rank;
- smallest singular values;
- largest singular value;
- a condition estimate.

At minimum do this for:

- one representative TSO model;
- one representative model from each DSO;
- every previously sensitive/failing positive-bootstrap state.

If full SVD is impractical, use a sparse extremal-singular-value or rank-revealing alternative and state the limitation.

Also identify pairs/groups of equality rows with nearly collinear normalized gradients.

## A6. Constraint-curvature audit

For nonlinear quadratic/bilinear rows report raw second-derivative/Hessian coefficient scales where practical.

Pay particular attention to:

- `sess_snet_def`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `sess_comp`;
- `ess_comp`;
- `sg_capability`;
- branch-current/apparent-power limits;
- squared-voltage/product definitions.

For shared ESS explicitly evaluate the bootstrap power ratings:

- `1.0635e-4 p.u.`;
- `2.1270e-4 p.u.`;
- `3.1905e-4 p.u.`;

with current:

`kappa = 1/S_rated`.

Distinguish clearly among:

- small Jacobian;
- large curvature;
- tiny inequality margin;
- exact rank degeneracy;
- near-linear dependence.

Do not collapse them into one generic "bad conditioning" label.

## A7. Objective-gradient scale

At the cold start report objective-gradient norms/coefficient ranges for major components that are present:

- physical/economic SMOPF objective;
- scenario-deviation regularization;
- proximal terms;
- ADMM augmentation.

Compare objective-gradient scale with suspicious constraint-Jacobian scales.

Do not change objective scaling.

# P5.3-A-RES — Stochastic RES and low-output audit

The current load and RES realizations come from historical-data-based copula/KDE models. Do not replace the copula model in this stage.

## RES1. Raw support and `abs()` post-processing

Instrument RES generation so the inverse-transformed samples are inspected **before**:

`np.abs(...)`.

For each network / season / RES type (PV, Wind) report:

- number of sampled hourly values;
- number/percentage negative before `abs`;
- minimum negative value;
- total/magnitude of positive generation created solely by reflection of negative samples;
- values above historical maximum;
- values below historical minimum;
- relevant quantiles before and after post-processing.

Do not alter `np.abs` during this audit.

## RES2. Tiny-generation population in the realized SMOPFs

After conversion to p.u. and after the actual one-scenario realization is selected, count available RES values in:

- exactly zero;
- `(0, 1e-6]`;
- `(1e-6, 1e-5]`;
- `(1e-5, 1e-4]`;
- `(1e-4, 1e-3]`;
- `>1e-3`.

For tiny values report exact:

- network;
- generator id/type;
- year;
- day;
- hour.

Cross-reference them with:

- `renewable_generation_is_unavailable`;
- `sg_capability`;
- `gen_pf_profile`;
- PF-control rows;
- local solve failures;
- unusually high IPOPT iteration counts where available.

Quantify how often the current structural switch at `EQUALITY_TOLERANCE` is exercised or nearly exercised.

Do not select a replacement threshold yet.

## RES3. Reactive-power/profile assumptions

For every curtailable RES generator report:

- `power_factor_control`;
- `min_pf`, `max_pf`;
- physical `pmax`, `qmin`, `qmax`;
- stochastic `pg_available`;
- stochastic `qg_available`;
- whether `qg_available` is identically zero;
- whether `gen_pf_profile` is instantiated;
- whether `sg_capability` is instantiated.

Explicitly identify rows where:

`q_available * pg == p_available * qg`

reduces to:

`p_available * qg == 0`

with very small positive `p_available`.

## RES4. Apparent-power capability interpretation

Determine whether current stochastic `sg_available = sqrt(pg_available^2 + qg_available^2)` is intentionally representing converter MVA rating or only stochastic renewable availability.

If `qg_available = 0`, the current capability radius collapses to `pg_available`.

Report whether the data/model contains a separate physical inverter MVA rating that could support a cleaner separation:

- stochastic active availability: `0 <= pg <= P_available`;
- converter capability: `pg^2 + qg^2 <= S_converter^2`.

Do not implement this physical change in the exact RES B2 experiment unless separately approved; it may change the feasible set.

## RES5. Spatial/scenario correlation observation

Audit how generated PV/wind profiles are assigned to individual generators.

Determine whether generator-to-generator spatial correlation is preserved or whether same-type generators effectively draw independently from a common synthetic pool.

Report this as a scenario-realism finding, separate from local NLP conditioning.

Do not change the sampling architecture in P5.3.

---

# P5.3-A-extra — Other structural checks

## Reference-angle/gauge audit

Confirm current reference-bus treatment of `f` and quantify any residual rotational/gauge degree of freedom.

Also audit DSO reference-bus `e` bounds and determine whether they effectively pin the coordinated interface voltage despite `enforce_vg = false`.

Do not change them in Phase A.

## Transformer auxiliary audit

Determine whether `r` and `r_sqr` variables constructed for non-transformer branches enter the generated NL problem.

If the writer eliminates them, classify as code cleanliness only.

If they reach IPOPT as unused/weakly-connected variables, classify as a conditioning issue.

## Branch-current audit

Quantify cancellation and derivative scales in current-limited branch rows based on:

`V_i^2 + V_j^2 - 2*W_ij_real`

multiplied by branch series-admittance magnitude squared.

Report whether low-impedance DSO branches create extreme coefficients or cancellation-sensitive constraints.

Do not reformulate branch currents unless this family ranks materially high.

---

# P5.3-A required output

Produce:

`P5_3_A_SMOPF_CONDITIONING_AUDIT.md`

Include a ranked `HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW` table for suspicious formulation families.

For every HIGH-risk item state:

- mathematical form;
- observed numerical evidence;
- physical role;
- exact failure mode: zero gradient, poor scale, near dependence, tiny margin, large curvature, etc.;
- possible exact reformulation;
- possible deliberate physical reformulation;
- expected numerical benefit;
- risk of changing the feasible set.

Do not start B1/B2/B3 until Phase A evidence is complete enough to verify the stated preconditions.

---

# P5.3-B1 — Exact reference-angle A/B

Proceed only if Phase A confirms that fixing the reference imaginary voltage does not violate an intentional interface convention.

Start from fresh accepted production models.

Do not carry any P5.2 narrow-band ESS change into this branch.

A — current production reference treatment.

B — exact gauge:

`f_ref = 0`.

Change only this fixing/bound condition.

Keep every other production equation and solver option unchanged.

Run the complete positive-bootstrap initialization.

Report:

- 51 final local outcomes;
- 48 network primary/recovery outcomes;
- IPOPT iterations;
- KKT metrics;
- objective values;
- failures by identity;
- equality-Jacobian rank/smallest-singular-value change on representative models;
- interface V/P/Q differences.

Acceptance:

- no material physical/economic change;
- no new failure family;
- gauge ambiguity removed;
- conditioning not worse.

Diagnostic only. Do not productionize automatically.

---

# P5.3-B2 — Exact RES low-output/profile cleanup A/B

Use a **fresh production baseline**, not B1.

Proceed only after the RES audit identifies the applicable generator classes.

Do not change stochastic samples.

Do not change the RES-off threshold in this exact A/B.

For curtailable RES without PF control:

If `q_available == 0` and `p_available > 0`, replace the cross-multiplied profile equality:

`q_available * pg == p_available * qg`

with exact unit-coefficient:

`qg == 0`.

If both `p_available` and `q_available` are nonzero, use an algebraically normalized relation with a unit coefficient, e.g.:

`qg == (q_available / p_available) * pg`

only where Phase A confirms the instantiated division is safe.

Where `qg` is exactly fixed to zero and `pg >= 0`, test replacing the corresponding redundant nonlinear capability:

`pg^2 + qg^2 <= S_available^2`

with exact linear:

`pg <= S_available`.

Apply this exact simplification only when it preserves the current feasible set. Do not apply it to RES with free reactive-power control.

Run:

- every previously sensitive bootstrap state;
- at least one low-output RES case from each DSO;
- one relevant TSO case where applicable;
- full 51-solve positive-bootstrap initialization.

Report:

- rows removed/replaced;
- Jacobian norm/coefficient improvement;
- NLP dimensions;
- primary/recovery outcomes;
- iterations;
- objectives;
- RES P/Q schedules;
- interface quantities;
- exact feasible-set equivalence checks.

Also provide, but do not implement:

- a proposed dedicated RES-off threshold based on physical/data scale rather than IPOPT tolerance;
- a recommendation on replacing `abs(negative_sample)` with physically clipped generation;
- any separate recommendation about converter MVA rating vs stochastic active availability.

---

# P5.3-B3 — Active-power ESS structural prototype

Use another **fresh accepted production baseline**.

Do not stack B1 or B2.

This is an authorized diagnostic physical reformulation, not an exact algebraic rewrite.

## B3.1 Trace all affected consumers first

Before changing a diagnostic branch, trace every network/coordination/ESSO consumer of:

- `sch`;
- `sdch`;
- `pch`;
- `pdch`;
- `pnet`;
- `qnet`;
- SOC;
- complementarity;
- converter limits;
- result processing;
- ADMM shared-ESS P/Q coupling;
- degradation/throughput.

Confirm that network-agent coordination is based on aggregate P/Q schedules and identify every place that would break if `sch/sdch` were removed.

## B3.2 Network SMOPF prototype

For ordinary and shared network ESS prototype:

`pnet = pch - pdch`

SOC from active power:

`SOC_t = SOC_{t-1} + eta_ch*pch*Delta_t - pdch*Delta_t/eta_dch`

Use the actual model time basis for `Delta_t`; do not assume it silently.

Converter capability:

`pnet^2 + qnet^2 <= S_rated^2`.

Reactive power remains converter loading but does not directly change stored battery energy.

Remove from the network diagnostic prototype:

- `sch`;
- `sdch`;
- `ess_snet_def`;
- `sess_snet_def`;
- `ess_pch_link`;
- `ess_pdch_link`;
- `sess_pch_link`;
- `sess_pdch_link`.

Replace the old apparent-power sum limit with explicit active-power bounds/sum constraints justified from the original device rating and intended physical behavior.

Complementarity acts on:

`pch * pdch`.

Do not silently change the configured complementarity tolerance.

Audit the new complementarity row's scale explicitly. If it remains a high-risk tiny bilinear inequality, report that rather than hiding it with arbitrary scaling.

Shared-ESS zero-capacity gating must remain safe.

## B3.3 Required physics tests

Demonstrate:

- pure Q: `pch = pdch = pnet = 0`, `qnet != 0` leaves SOC unchanged;
- pure charging changes SOC according to efficiency and time step;
- pure discharging changes SOC according to efficiency and time step;
- reactive power remains feasible up to converter capability;
- simultaneous active charging/discharging respects the intended complementarity semantics;
- zero-capacity shared ESS remains completely inactive;
- ordinary/shared P/Q sign conventions remain consistent with nodal balance and exported results.

## B3.4 Numerical tests

Run the complete positive-bootstrap **network initialization** and compare against current production:

- primary failures;
- recovery attempts;
- persistent failures;
- iterations;
- zero/near-zero Jacobian-row counts;
- smallest singular values / rank estimates where available;
- suspicious curvature coefficients;
- objective;
- P/Q schedules;
- SOC trajectories.

Do not enter ADMM with a partially converted ESS formulation unless all required ESSO/state-mapping dependencies are implemented consistently.

Do not rewrite ESSO cycling degradation in B3.

If the network prototype is favorable, produce a precise follow-on end-to-end plan covering:

- ESSO per-cohort `pch/pdch`;
- aggregate P/Q coordination;
- active/cell-side throughput;
- cycling degradation;
- SoH;
- sensitivities;
- state mapping;
- result exports.

Calendar degradation remains out of scope.

---

# Isolation and commit discipline

B1, B2, and B3 are independent A/B experiments.

Each begins from the same accepted current production baseline.

Do not accumulate B1 into B2 or B2 into B3.

Diagnostic scripts/tests may be added, but production source files must be restored to the accepted baseline at the end of each diagnostic branch unless a later planner instruction explicitly authorizes a production commit.

Do not combine production edits from this stage into existing accepted commits.

---

# P5.3 final report

Produce:

`P5_3_SMOPF_STRUCTURAL_REVIEW.md`

It must contain:

1. full conditioning ranking;
2. stochastic RES audit;
3. reference-angle A/B result;
4. RES exact-cleanup A/B result;
5. active-power ESS network-prototype result;
6. before/after NLP dimensions;
7. primary/recovery/failure counts;
8. Jacobian/rank/curvature evidence;
9. physical-equivalence or deliberate-model-change statement for every experiment;
10. recommended production changes in priority order.

Answer explicitly:

- Should `f_ref = 0` be productionized?
- Which RES equations should be reformulated exactly?
- Is a dedicated RES-off threshold justified, and what should determine it?
- Should negative copula RES samples be clipped rather than reflected with `abs`?
- Is spatial RES correlation currently preserved adequately?
- Is stochastic RES availability being conflated with converter MVA capability?
- Does the active-power ESS prototype materially improve conditioning?
- Can `sch/sdch` be removed safely from the network SMOPF?
- Which remaining constraint family is the highest numerical risk?
- Is the P5.2 narrow-band workaround still needed after cleaner reformulations?

Finish with exactly:

`P5.3 COMPLETE — structural conditioning review ready for planner decision`

Then stop.

# Historical evidence retained for reference

The following summarizes earlier local-NLP work. It remains valid evidence but does not constrain P5.3 where the current-stage instructions above explicitly supersede it.

## Original frozen reference failure

Historical frozen model:

`data/SRP1/Results/FrozenSMOPF/frozen_DSO_node7_case33_2_2025_Winter_cycle10.pkl`

Metadata:

- DSO node 7;
- `case33_2`;
- 2025 Winter;
- ADMM cycle 10;
- warm start;
- `rho_v = 1.5`;
- `rho_pf = 2.25`;
- `rho_ess = 3.375`.

Repeated baseline:

- primary exact-Hessian MA97: `internalSolverError / Error in step computation`;
- limited-memory recovery: `maxIterations`.

Tightening only explicit `vmag` or `vmag_sqr` bounds did not help.

Removing non-reference explicit `vmag` variables/equalities from the active DSO NLP converted the decisive frozen failure into a clean primary exact-Hessian success. This led to the accepted production `vmag_nodes` refactor.

## P2/P3 progression

The production `vmag_nodes` refactor passed multiple preserved local failures and live seed-2026 operational smoke tests.

Residual failures then localized around network-side shared-ESS operation. Audits identified the shared-ESS squared-magnitude equality as a major candidate because all derivatives vanish near zero dispatch.

Removing the row entirely fixed failures but materially violated the relation and was rejected.

Equivalent in-place scaling experiments proved that row normalization itself could clear decisive DSO and TSO exact-Hessian failures while preserving the physical equality.

## P4 accepted scaling

Shared ESS:

`kappa * ((sch-sdch)^2 - pnet^2 - qnet^2) = 0`, `kappa = 1/S_rated`.

Ordinary ESS uses the analogous immutable build-time scale.

The shared scale is mutable on reused models and preserves KKT multiplier consistency when capacity changes.

## P5 planning integration

Zero-investment operational evaluation converged cleanly, but the tiny positive-bootstrap candidate exposed new cold-start failures before ADMM.

Scalar caps on shared-ESS `kappa` produced strongly non-monotone convergence and relocated failures.

## P5.2 narrow-band evidence

Replacing the hard shared-ESS zero-gradient equality by a tiny two-sided ranged row gave the first full positive-bootstrap initialization with zero persistent failures. At `epsilon_rel = 1e-4`, all 48 network solves succeeded on the primary exact-Hessian path with zero recovery.

However, the nominal physical band was below the solver's effective feasibility resolution at tiny capacity, especially in TSO models. This is why P5.3 now prioritizes a broader structural formulation audit rather than productionizing the narrow-band workaround.
